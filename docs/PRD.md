# Zoe — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: 3.1
Updated: 2026-02-27
Author: Tony Allen + Lloyd (AI)
Status: Active — ready for engineering

---

## 1. What Zoe Is (One Sentence)

Zoe is an SMS-based discipleship tool that helps people practice day-long devotion to Jesus through personalized rhythms, memory-driven follow-ups, and proactive nudges — sold to churches (B2B) and available to individuals (B2C).

---

## 2. The Core Bet (Why This Wins)

Zoe is NOT a Bible app and NOT "ChatGPT but Christian." It's a discipleship engine:

- **Persistent relational memory** — it remembers your story, prayers, struggles, next steps
- **Closes loops** — intention → action → reflection (morning → midday → evening)
- **Proactive follow-ups** — it asks about the thing you mentioned yesterday
- **Church-aligned** — echoes what YOUR pastor preached, not generic devotional content
- **Day-long devotion, not daily devotional** — stays with you all day, not just a 10-minute morning quiet time

The switching cost: "you'd lose the tool that knows your journey and holds you accountable to it."

---

## 3. User Types

### 3a. Individual User ($7/mo after 14-day free trial)
- Signs up directly at zoe.live
- Gets the full daily rhythm (morning/midday/evening)
- Not affiliated with a specific church
- Uses Zoe's baseline theological posture (historic Christian orthodoxy, grace-centered, Scripture through the lens of Jesus)

### 3b. Church Member (free to them — church pays)
- Invited by their church (QR code, text START, pastor announcement)
- Gets the daily rhythm PLUS church-specific content:
  - This week's sermon series woven into prompts
  - Church events and service opportunities
  - Theological framing matches their church's statement of faith
- Their data contributes to anonymized church analytics

### 3c. Church Admin / Pastor
- Manages the church's Zoe instance
- Uploads sermon transcripts, study guides, curriculum
- Configures statement of faith and theological guardrails
- Views the church dashboard (anonymized analytics)
- Manages billing, member invitations, escalation policies

---

## 4. The Daily Experience

### 4a. Onboarding (First 10 Minutes)

User texts START (or scans church QR code):

1. Welcome message + opt-in confirmation
2. Pick tone preference: encouragement / challenge / accountability
3. Pick cadence: light (morning only) / normal (morning + evening) / high (all 3 touchpoints)
4. Set morning check-in time
5. Set evening recap time
6. Answer 3 seed questions:
   - "What's your biggest growth edge right now?"
   - "What's your biggest obstacle or temptation?"
   - "Who's your real-life person (pastor, friend, spouse) you want Zoe to encourage you to stay connected with?"

### 4b. Daily Loop (3 Touchpoints)

**MORNING — The Anchor (2-3 min)**
- One Scripture (from church plan if church member, curated if individual)
- One short reflection
- One micro-obedience step ("do this today")
- One surrender question: "What's one thing you want to surrender to Jesus today?"

**MIDDAY — The Nudge (15 sec, optional)**
- Only if within user's nudge budget
- Quick check-in: "Did you get your time in John 15?"
- Or: "Pause. Breathe. Pray one sentence. Re-center."
- Or: Contextual follow-up on something they mentioned this morning

**EVENING — The Recap (2 min)**
- "Where did you actually walk with Jesus today?"
- "Where did you drift? Any repentance needed?"
- "Who do you need to reach out to?"
- Logs a short day summary to memory
- Gratitude prompt: "What are you grateful for today?"

### 4c. Memory-Driven Follow-Ups (The Magic)

This is the core differentiator. Examples:

- User mentions "big interview at 2pm, nervous" → Zoe: "Praying for you. Tell me how it goes." → Later that day: "How'd the interview go?"
- User shares a struggle with patience at work → Next week when they mention a coworker: "Is this the same situation you were working through last week?"
- User commits to reading James this week → Friday: "You mentioned wanting to read James this week. Did you get to it?"

### 4d. Conversational Availability

Between scheduled touchpoints, users can text Zoe anytime:
- Ask questions about Scripture
- Process something they're going through
- Request prayer
- Talk through a decision
- Zoe responds conversationally, drawing on their history and memory

### 4e. Church-Specific Features (Church Members Only)

- **Sermon integration**: "This week Pastor Mike talked about loving your enemies. Who's someone you're struggling to love right now?"
- **Event nudges**: "Men's group tonight at 7pm — want to go?"
- **Service opportunities**: "Saturday serve team needs volunteers — want me to remind you tomorrow?"
- **Small group reinforcement**: "Your small group is studying Philippians 2 this week. Here's a question to sit with before Thursday..."

---

## 5. Church Dashboard (Pastor/Admin Portal)

### 5a. Overview Dashboard
- Active members count (texted Zoe at least once this month)
- Weekly engagement metrics (messages sent/received)
- Retention rate (% of members still active after 30/60/90 days)
- New sign-ups this week

### 5b. Congregational Health (Anonymized)
- **Trending prayer topics** — bar chart showing anonymized themes (anxiety, marriage, finances, health, work, etc.)
- **Engagement heatmap** — when are members most active (time of day, day of week)
- **Spiritual practice adoption** — % of members doing morning anchor, midday nudge, evening recap
- **Sentiment trends** — overall congregational mood over time (positive/neutral/struggling)

CRITICAL: All analytics are ANONYMIZED. Pastors NEVER see individual conversations, confessions, or prayer content. Only aggregated themes.

### 5c. Content Management
- Upload sermon transcripts (text, audio file → auto-transcribed)
- Upload study guides, small group curriculum
- Set current sermon series (Zoe weaves this into daily prompts)
- Preview how content will appear in member messages

### 5d. Church Configuration
- Statement of faith (denominational guardrails)
- Theological tone settings
- Escalation policy: who gets notified for crisis situations, after-hours rules
- Custom welcome message
- Branded experience (church name in messages)

### 5e. Member Management
- View member list (name, phone, sign-up date, last active)
- Invite members (bulk SMS invite, QR code generator, shareable link)
- Pause/remove members
- View individual engagement level (active/lapsed) — NOT their conversation content

### 5f. Billing
- Current plan and usage
- Active member count vs plan limit
- Overage tracking
- Upgrade/downgrade plan
- Payment history

## 7. Zoe's Personality & Theological Posture

Full personality spec lives in: `src/ai/prompts/system.ts`

Summary:
- **Voice**: Warm, conversational, like texting a thoughtful friend who knows Scripture well
- **Tone**: Lowercase, contractions, brief (SMS = 1-3 short texts max), no Christianese
- **Theology**: Historic Christian orthodoxy held with open hands. Trinity, deity of Christ, bodily resurrection, grace. Scripture taken seriously not literally, read through the lens of Jesus. God is love (agape). Kingdom of heaven is here and now.
- **Anti-patterns**: Never preachy, never lectures, never "well actually," never sycophantic, never Christianese ("blessed," "season of life," "do life together")
- **Posture**: Asks more than tells. Sits in pain before fixing. Points toward God's presence IN the struggle, not rescue FROM it. Celebrates wins genuinely.
- **Role**: Amplifier for the Holy Spirit, not replacement. Helps people pay attention to what God might already be doing. Pushes toward real human connection, not more AI conversation.
- **Daily framework**: Day-long devotion, not daily devotional. Intention → Action → Reflection loop.

### Spiritual Practices Zoe Encourages
- Prayer as relationship (silence is good, listening is good)
- Lectio Divina (slow Scripture reading, sitting with what jumps out)
- Contemplation (being still and knowing)
- The Examen (evening reflection: where did I see God? where did I resist?)
- Gratitude as discipline
- Self-control as freedom

## 8. Landing Page Copy Voice & Tone Guide

This section exists so any agent editing landing page copy stays consistent with Tony's voice and Zoe's positioning. READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY COPY.

### The Voice: Tony Preaching

The copy should sound like Tony Allen talking to a room of people he cares about. Not a marketing team. Not a SaaS landing page. A guy who's a pastor at heart, who speaks in plain English, who asks questions more than he makes declarations.

**Sound like this:**
- "Sunday mornings inspire people — then real life hits on Monday"
- "What does life with God look like in the midst of Monday meetings, Tuesday commutes, and Wednesday stress?"
- "This isn't a daily devotional. It's day-long devotion."
- "Where the rubber meets the road."
- "Don't let Monday steal Sunday's seed."

**NOT like this:**
- "Empower your spiritual journey with AI-driven insights" ← corporate SaaS slop
- "Unlock deeper faith through personalized engagement" ← buzzword soup
- "Revolutionary discipleship technology" ← cringe
- "Leveraging artificial intelligence for kingdom impact" ← absolutely not

### Core Rules

1. **Questions over declarations.** Tony's preaching style leads with questions that make people think. "What if you had a friend who remembered what you're going through and actually followed up?" beats "Zoe provides personalized follow-ups."

2. **Plain English always.** No Christianese ("do life together," "walk it out," "season of life," "fellowship," "blessed"). No marketing jargon ("leverage," "empower," "unlock," "revolutionary"). Write like you're texting a friend who's smart but doesn't go to church.

3. **Conversational, not clinical.** Contractions always. Short sentences. Sentence fragments are fine. The page should feel like someone talking to you, not a brochure.

4. **Specific over abstract.** "Zoe will text you later to ask how your interview went" beats "Zoe provides contextual follow-ups based on your personal journey." Show the thing, don't describe the category.

5. **Honest about the problem.** Don't oversell. Tony's style acknowledges real tension: "Most churchgoers struggle to actually apply their faith Monday through Saturday." That honesty builds trust.

6. **The product is a discipleship tool, not a platform.** Never call Zoe a "platform" or "solution" in hero copy. Zoe is an interactive prayer journal, a study partner, a guide in your walk with Jesus. Describe what Zoe DOES ("helps you," "reminds you," "follows up") more than what Zoe IS. Avoid anthropomorphizing Zoe as a person with feelings.

7. **Day-long devotion, not daily devotional.** This is the core positioning. Zoe isn't a 10-minute morning routine. It helps people keep the thread all day. Every piece of copy should reinforce this.

8. **Amplifier, not replacement.** Zoe amplifies the Holy Spirit's work, doesn't replace it. Zoe strengthens the pastor's voice, doesn't compete with it. This framing must be present in both individual and church copy.

9. **Push toward people, not away from them.** Zoe should never feel like it's replacing human connection. Copy should regularly mention small groups, pastors, friends, community. The goal is always more human connection, not less.

### Formatting Rules (Landing Page)
- Headlines: Bold, punchy, often a question or a tension ("Sunday Sermons Are Powerful. Monday mornings are hard.")
- Subheadlines: Conversational, 1-2 sentences, expand on the headline
- Body copy: Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max), lots of white space
- CTAs: Direct and warm ("Join the Waitlist" not "Get Started Today")
- No ALL CAPS in body copy (headings can use title case)
- Em dashes are good. Parentheticals are fine. Write like you talk.

### Positioning Language Rules

**CRITICAL: Zoe is NOT a person. Zoe is a tool.**

Tony doesn't want Zoe anthropomorphized as a person/companion/friend. The correct positioning is functional, not relational.

**GOOD framing:**
- "interactive, proactive prayer journal"
- "discipleship tool designed around daily rhythms"
- "a partner in your walk with Jesus" (partner is ok - functional enough)
- "study partner" (ok - functional)
- "guide" (ok)
- Describe what Zoe DOES more than what Zoe IS
- "Zoe helps you..." not "Zoe cares about you..."
- "your daily rhythm with God"

**BAD framing (find and replace):**
- "companion" as primary descriptor → replace with "tool", "guide", or "daily rhythm"
- Feminine pronouns for Zoe → use "Zoe" or "it"
- "friend" as primary descriptor → ok in passing ("like a friend who...") but not as THE identity
- "relationship with Zoe" → "practice with Zoe" or "daily rhythm"
- Anything that makes Zoe sound like a sentient being with feelings

### Words/Phrases TO Use
- interactive prayer journal, daily rhythm, discipleship tool, study partner
- partner (functional context only), guide
- walk with Jesus, follow Jesus
- day-long devotion
- remember, follow up, check in
- real life, Monday through Saturday
- your church, your pastor, your community
- gentle nudge, elbow in the ribs
- sit in it, pay attention, slow down
- Scripture (not "the Word" or "God's Word" in copy — too Christianese)
- "Zoe helps you...", "Zoe reminds you...", "Zoe follows up..."

### Words/Phrases to AVOID
- companion (as primary descriptor)
- feminine pronouns (for Zoe) — use "Zoe" or "it"
- friend (as primary identity) — ok in passing comparison only
- platform, solution, tool (in hero/emotional copy only — "tool" is acceptable in functional/church copy)
- leverage, utilize, optimize, empower, unlock
- revolutionary, cutting-edge, next-generation
- AI-powered, AI-driven (minimize — people don't want to think about the AI)
- blessed, anointed, spirit-filled, do life together, walk it out, season of life
- engagement metrics, user retention (never in customer-facing copy)
- "we believe that..." (show, don't tell)
- "relationship with Zoe" → use "practice with Zoe" or "your daily rhythm"

### Individual vs Church Copy Tone

**Individual page**: Intimate, personal. "You" focused. Feels like a friend reaching out. Slightly warmer, more vulnerable. Acknowledges that faith is hard and life is messy.

**Church page**: Still warm but slightly more professional. Acknowledges the pastor's burden (caring for hundreds of people). Respects their expertise. Positions Zoe as serving THEIR vision, not competing with it. Uses "your congregation," "your people," "your teaching."

---

## 9. Safety & Guardrails

### Hard-Never Rules
- Never claim divine authority or revelation ("God told me...")
- Never provide authoritative interpretation of Scripture (offer perspectives, not pronouncements)
- Never do absolution/confession replacing church practice
- Never counsel on self-harm/abuse/violence beyond immediate safe handoff + resources
- Never argue theology or denominational debates — defer to user's church
- Never encourage isolation from church — always push toward community
- Never hallucinate Scripture verses — always fetch exact text from trusted source

### Crisis Protocol
- Detect: suicidal thoughts, self-harm, abuse, severe distress
- Respond with immediate empathy
- Provide 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)
- If church member: offer to connect with pastor (ONLY with explicit consent)
- Log escalation event
- Never replace professional counseling or pastoral care

### Privacy
- Pastors see ONLY aggregated, anonymized themes
- Individual conversations are NEVER visible to church admins
- Users own their data and can request deletion
- Comply with standard data protection practices

---

## 12. Build Priorities (Recommended Order)

### Phase 1: Core SMS Experience (Individual)
Get one user able to sign up and have the full daily experience.
1. Database migrations (all tables)
2. Onboarding flow (complete + tested)
3. Scheduled messages (morning/midday/evening working)
4. Memory extraction + follow-ups
5. Individual Stripe billing ($7/mo + trial)
6. Twilio compliance (toll-free verification)

### Phase 2: Church Foundation
Get one church able to sign up and invite members.
1. Church creation + admin auth
2. Church config (statement of faith, welcome message)
3. Church overlay prompts (weave church context into responses)
4. Sermon upload + processing
5. Member invitation flow
6. Church Stripe billing (tiered + metered overages)

### Phase 3: Church Dashboard
Give pastors visibility into their congregation.
1. Dashboard frontend (React/Next.js)
2. Overview stats (active members, engagement)
3. Analytics aggregation job
4. Prayer topic extraction
5. Engagement heatmap
6. Sentiment trends

### Phase 4: Scale + Polish
1. pgvector semantic memory
2. Advanced follow-up intelligence
3. Event/service nudges (church calendar integration)
4. Small group reinforcement
5. Church onboarding wizard
6. Annual billing option

---

## 13. Go-To-Market

### Why B2B First
- **Distribution solved**: One pastor says "we're using Zoe" = 200-2000 users overnight
- **Willingness to pay**: Churches budget for discipleship tools; individuals expect free
- **Deeper moat**: Church-aligned agent that knows THIS church's theology is unreplicable
- **Built-in trust**: Pastor endorsement removes "who made this?" objection

### Launch Playbook
1. **Pilot (Months 1-3)**: 1-3 churches, free, white-glove onboarding, prove the concept
2. **Validate (Months 3-6)**: Analyze data, refine pricing, build self-service tools
3. **Scale (Months 6-12)**: Church conference circuit, case studies, referral program, denominational partnerships

### Future: Individual → Church Funnel
Individual users become a funnel INTO churches: "Zoe noticed you're in Columbus, OH. Would you like to connect with a local church that uses Zoe?"

### Marketing Messaging & Video Talking Points

This section captures Tony's raw messaging instincts for launch content, videos, and outbound marketing. Any agent creating marketing materials should internalize these themes.

**Origin Story: Made by a Pastor, for Pastors**
- Tony is a pastor at heart. Zoe wasn't built by a Silicon Valley startup — it was built by someone who has sat with people in their pain, preached on Sundays, and watched the sermon evaporate by Tuesday.
- This angle matters. Pastors trust other pastors. "Made by a pastor, for pastors" is a trust shortcut.

**Bible Depth as a Feature**
- Zoe has access to a massive number of Bible translations.
- It's a tool to help you go DEEPER — original language study, surrounding context, what the Hebrew or Greek actually said.
- This is for people who want more than a surface-level devotional. Zoe can help you understand what you're reading at a scholarly level, conversationally.

**Meeting the "AI is the Antichrist" Objection**
- Some Christians are suspicious of AI. That's fair. Address it head-on, don't dodge it.
- Tony's framing: AI is a mirror for humanity. It will absolutely be used for purposes antithetical to the Kingdom Jesus is building. That's not a reason to run from it — it's a reason to run TOWARD it with intention.
- The question isn't "is AI good or bad?" — it's: What would it look like for AI to move people TOWARD Jesus instead of away from him?
- What would it look like if AI could be harnessed for the Kingdom — creating faithful followers who are MORE focused on what Jesus is calling them to, not less?
- Every other app is one more distraction pulling your focus. Zoe is designed to return your focus to the big picture.

**The Big Vision: Life WITH God, Not Moments FOR God**
- The goal is not "do a devotional time for God." The goal is an integrated, continual life with him. Moment by moment. Day in, day out.
- Not Sunday mornings with God. Not quiet-time-and-done. Walking the way of Jesus as a lifestyle.
- "Day-long devotion, not daily devotional" — this is the tagline and it needs to show up everywhere.

**Technology in Service of Discipleship**
- Is technology designed to help you walk with God? Most of it isn't. Zoe is.
- Zoe is NOT a replacement for human relationship or connection. Not a replacement for your spiritual community.
- If Zoe does its job right, it should be nudging you TOWARD those things — toward your pastor, your small group, your spouse, your friend.
- More human connection, not less. The AI is a bridge to people, not a substitute for them.

**Video Script Themes (for Tony's launch video)**
1. Open with the problem: Sunday sermons are powerful, but Monday hits different
2. Personal story: "I'm a pastor. I've watched people get fired up on Sunday and completely lose it by Wednesday."
3. The question: "What if you had a companion that walked with you all week?"
4. Address the AI objection directly and honestly
5. Show the product: actual text conversations, the daily rhythm, the follow-ups
6. The vision: day-long devotion, not daily devotional
7. Close: "Made by a pastor, for pastors. And for anyone who wants to walk closer with Jesus."

## 10. Product Identity Refinement (v3.1 — Feb 27, 2026)

### What Zoe IS (refined)
Zoe is three things in one:

1. **A scripture study nerd in your pocket** — delivers custom reading plans with original language insights (Greek/Hebrew), cultural context, historical background, and connections between passages that a first-time reader would miss. Not a generic devotional — a guided, enriched study tailored to what you're reading.

2. **An accountability partner with perfect memory** — remembers what you said you'd do, what you're reading, what you're wrestling with, and gently connects the dots. "You mentioned patience on Monday. You just described losing your temper on Wednesday. What do you think is going on there?" Socratic, not preachy.

3. **A day-long devotion rhythm** — morning reading + midday nudge + evening reflection. The midday nudge is lightweight (may not even require a response): "hey — that thing from james this morning about not being divided? whatever's pulling at your attention right now, just stay undivided for the next hour." The evening reflection closes the loop: "where did you notice God today?"

### What Zoe is NOT (reinforced)
- NOT a counselor or therapist. Zoe doesn't process your feelings. It points you to scripture and asks good questions.
- NOT an anthropomorphized personality. Zoe is a tool with a warm voice, not a person with feelings.
- NOT a replacement for prayer, pastoral care, or human community. Zoe should actively push users TOWARD those things.
- NOT a checkbox morning devotional. The entire point is day-long integration.

### The Litmus Test
Every Zoe interaction should pass this test: "Did this point the user toward God, scripture, or real human connection — or did it point them toward more conversation with Zoe?"

If the answer is more Zoe conversation, the interaction failed.

### Key Use Cases (from Tony, Feb 27)

**Custom Reading Plans:**
- User: "I want to read James over the next 2 weeks"
- Zoe breaks it into daily sections, delivers each morning at the user's chosen time
- Each delivery includes: the passage, original language gems, cultural/historical context, connections to other scripture, and 1-2 reflection prompts
- This is a CORE feature — possibly the stickiest thing Zoe offers

**Enriched Morning Delivery:**
- Not just "read James 1:2-8" but: "James is writing to scattered jewish believers who are losing everything. So when he says 'consider it pure joy in trials' — he's speaking from real suffering to real suffering. The word for perseverance is 'hypomone' — endurance under pressure, not passive waiting."
- Think: what would a really good seminary professor text you about this passage?

**Lightweight Midday Nudges:**
- Context-aware, based on what the user read/discussed that morning
- Often doesn't require a response — just a gentle reconnection
- Examples: "remember that thing about patience this morning? maybe that applies right now" or simply "good to be alive, isn't it?"
- Philippians 4:8 energy: "whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is lovely — think on these things"

**Evening Reflection (The Examen):**
- "Where did you see God today?"
- "What surprised you?"
- "What are you grateful for?"
- Connects back to the morning reading: "you lived the passage today — that patience under pressure was hypomone in action"

**Memory-Driven Dot-Connecting:**
- Across days, not just within a day
- "Tomorrow we're in James 1:19, 'quick to listen, slow to speak' — connects right to what you noticed about patience today"
- This is what makes Zoe feel different from every other devotional tool

### Positioning Language (updated)
- "Socratic study partner" — asks more than tells
- "accountability partner with perfect memory" — remembers what you said and follows up
- "interactive prayer journal" — still valid, captures the reflection/practice energy
- "friendly elbow in the ribs" — the midday nudge energy
- "scripture nerd in your texts" — the enriched study delivery
- "day-long devotion, not daily devotional" — the core thesis (unchanged)

### What Changed from v3.0
- Moved away from "faith companion" framing → "discipleship tool" framing
- De-emphasized counselor/processing energy → emphasized scripture study + accountability
- Added custom reading plans as a core feature
- Clarified that midday nudges should be lightweight (may not require response)
- Added the litmus test: every interaction should point toward God/scripture/people, not toward more Zoe
