    question: "Is Zoe replacing my pastor or my church?",
    answer:
      "Not even close. Zoe is a partner between Sundays — not a substitute for real community. Zoe will actually push you toward your small group, your pastor, and the people in your life. The goal is more human connection, not less.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just ChatGPT with a Bible?",
    answer:
      "No. ChatGPT requires you to initiate everything — it waits for you to prompt it. Zoe is proactive. Zoe reaches out to you unprompted, checks in on what you're praying about, and initiates conversations so you don't have to remember to log into a tool.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Zoe trying to replace the Holy Spirit?",
    answer:
      "No — Zoe reminds you to listen for Him. Think of Zoe as the friend who nudges you and says 'hey, have you thought about what God might be doing here?' Zoe points you back to Jesus, every time. The goal isn't more AI in your life — it's more awareness of God in your life.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Zoe biblically accurate?",
    answer:
      "Zoe is rooted in Scripture and takes the Bible seriously — the history, the context, the original languages. Zoe isn't going to make stuff up or proof-text you with a verse ripped out of context. Think of it like a tool that's done the homework and can help you go deeper.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this cause people to form unhealthy relationships with AI?",
    answer:
      "This is a great question and we take it seriously. Think of Zoe like a really good journal that talks back — or a study partner. Nobody anthropomorphizes their journal, but they do feel connected to the practice of journaling. That's the energy. Zoe is an interactive, proactive prayer journal — not a simulated person. It helps you process, reflect, and stay consistent in your walk with God. The goal is always to nudge you toward real people — your pastor, your small group, your spouse, your friend. More human connection, not less.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about privacy?",
    answer:
      "Private by default. Your church does not see your individual messages unless you explicitly share something. Church leaders see aggregated trends only. Human access is restricted and audited, and AI training on your content is opt-in only.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do humans at Zoe read my messages?",
    answer:
      "Not by default. Internal access is role-restricted, logged, and limited to specific support or safety workflows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data used to train AI models?",
    answer: "Not by default. Optional AI improvement/data sharing is opt-in.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer:
      "After a 30-day free trial, it's $99 a year. Cancel anytime. No contracts, no guilt trips.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Zoe remember what I've said?",
    answer:
      "Zoe stores your responses across conversations so it can follow up on commitments you've made, notice patterns, and ask better questions over time. You control how much it remembers, and you can ask it to forget anything at any time.",
  },
