            The Psalms are the prayer book of the Bible — raw, honest, and deeply human. This 30-day journey pairs one psalm per day with a contemplative reading practice. Some days you'll sit in praise. Others, you'll wrestle with doubt. That's the point.

            <p>For three thousand years, people have prayed the Psalms. They cover everything — joy and grief, praise and rage, confidence and doubt. There's nothing you're feeling right now that the Psalms haven't already put into words.</p>
            <p>This journey takes you through 30 psalms in 30 days, but it's not a speed-read. Each day you'll practice lectio divina — reading slowly, sitting with a phrase, and letting it work on you. Zoe delivers the psalm each morning, walks you through the contemplative reading, and then follows up throughout the day to help you carry it with you. By the end, you won't just know the Psalms better — you'll have a practice for reading Scripture that lasts.</p>
