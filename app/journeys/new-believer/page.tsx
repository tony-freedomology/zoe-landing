            <p>New faith is tender. There are a thousand questions, a lot of excitement, and also a lot of uncertainty. What does it even mean to follow Jesus in an ordinary week?</p>
            <p>This 21-day journey is built for exactly that season. Each day covers one foundational topic — from prayer to doubt to baptism to the long walk ahead. Zoe checks in three times a day with the passage, a reflection question, and space to actually think it through.</p>
