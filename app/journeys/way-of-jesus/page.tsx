            <p>The Gospels are the heartbeat of the Christian faith. Everything else in Scripture points toward or flows from the story of Jesus. But most of us have read these stories so many times that they've lost their edge. We know the parables but don't live them. We admire the Sermon on the Mount but don't practice it.</p>
            <p>This 40-day journey changes that. Each day, Zoe walks you through a key passage from the life and teachings of Jesus — with context you've probably never heard, questions that get uncomfortable, and a daily challenge that puts the teaching into practice. By day 40, you'll have engaged with the core of Jesus' message and tested it against your actual life.</p>
