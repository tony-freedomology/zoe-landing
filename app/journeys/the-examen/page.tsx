            <p>Ignatius of Loyola called the Examen the most important prayer practice a person could have. The idea is straightforward: before you go to sleep, review your day. Where did you feel most alive? Where did you feel most drained? Where was God present — even if you didn't notice at the time?</p>
            <p>This 14-day journey walks you through the Examen step by step, adding depth each day. By the end, you'll have a nightly practice that takes five minutes and changes how you see everything else. Each evening, Zoe walks you through the reflection and helps you notice patterns you might miss on your own.</p>
